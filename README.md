# Healthcare Operational Efficiency & Patient No-Show Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes patient appointment data to identify operational inefficiencies and key drivers behind patient no-shows.

The objective is to reduce missed appointments and minimize revenue loss using data-driven insights.



##  Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- SQL (MySQL)
- Power BI
- DAX




##  Key Insights
- Overall no-show rate stands at 28.19%, indicating operational inefficiency.
- Longer waiting times are associated with higher no-show probability.
- Patients who did not receive SMS reminders show higher absenteeism.
- Certain age groups demonstrate comparatively higher no-show behavior.
- Missed appointments contribute to measurable revenue loss.



##  Dashboard Features
- KPI Cards (Total Appointments, No Shows, No Show Rate, Revenue Loss)
- Waiting Time Impact Analysis
- Age Group Risk Analysis
- SMS Reminder Effectiveness
- Revenue Impact Visualization



##  Business Impact
This analysis helps healthcare providers:
- Improve appointment scheduling
- Enhance reminder strategies
- Reduce revenue leakage
- Optimize operational efficiency
